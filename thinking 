Female godness ? Just some flesh goods.

I will only fall in love this one time . Also I only marry this one time . This is not my emotional single-mindedness to her . It is just my attitude to love . If it fails , then in my view love is not existed . If love is not existed , I will not find it anymore and live alone to finish my simple dreams or do nothing .

I have no need in sex . But what is love ? I am still angry about her laughing with that male . I am angry with her cooperation to be kissed by him , her indifferent attitude to sex with any male . Because I cannot love a male , I am not homosexual . I can only fall in love with female . It actually is a kind of fear , a fear of her losing love on me . Love is a kind of emotional trade . I am afraid of losing everything and obtaining nothing in this trade .

Love is a scam , but I beg for a mercy from it . Because I am weak now , I have no confidence about myself . Marriage is a salvation to escape the misery of love . It will end every suspicion and bad thought . But the price is souls unless both of them are strong enough to accept the reality . The reality is the life is worth nothing .
